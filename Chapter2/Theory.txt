Q3- And operator
    Expression     |  Value
    True and True  |   True
    True and False |   False 
    False and True |   False 
    Fasle and False|   False 
    
    or operator

    True or False |   True 
    False or True |   True 
    Fasle or False|   False 
    
    not operator
    Expression    |  Value

Q5- Comparison operators are

    >= - greater than or equal to
    <= - less than or equal to
    != - not equal to
    >  - Greater than
    <  - Less than
    
Q6- Assignment operator stores the value in RHS and store it in the
    variable in the LHS, but the == checks if both values are 
    equal and returns a boolean value
    
Q7- Condition is a flow control statement which evaluate a Boolean
    expression and executes a statement based on the boolean obtained
    we would usually use this when we want to execute a code only
    when a particular condition is satisfied
    
Q8- Block 1
     print('eggs')
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')
    else:
        print('ham')
    print('spam')
    
    Block 2
        print('bacon')
        
    Block-3
        print('ham')

Q10- ctrl+c

Q11- break statement ignores the rest of the code and breaks out of the code
     Continue statement dosent break out of the code but ignores the rest of the code and goes back to the start of the loop

Q12- range(10) - loop executes 10 times
     range(0,10)- loop executes from 10 times from 0 to 9 same as range(10)
     range(0,10,1)- one specifies the step value to increase
     
Q14- spam.bacon()
